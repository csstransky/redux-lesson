+ Redux based on Flux, a design pattern alternative to MVC
+ Developed in 2015 by Dan Abramov & Andrew Clark
+ Flux designed by Facebook, a variation to MVC
+ The original issue was having many models and many views that could each 
interact with one another and cause unintended consequences because a model
change could mess with the model for another view
+ Flux: Action -> Dispatcher -> Store -> View -> Action -> etc...
+ DATA FLOWS IN ONE DIRECTION
+ All changes will begin with an Action, and end on the View 

+ Redux isn't exactly Flux, it's Flux-lite
+ Redux combines the Dispatcher and Store into simply a Store, this means that
you can only do Actions on 1 Store (instead of a Dispatcher being able to 
affect multiple Stores at once)
+ All data is stored in one State, and instead of breaking that State into
multiple Objects, multiple Functions are used instead to mess with specific
Leaves in the State tree
+ This means that Redux (as well as JS and React) use the 
Functional Programming paradigm
+ Redux uses the idea of composition, where the inputs and outputs of each 
subsequent function affects the final result:
```
import { compose } from 'redux'

const getPercent = compose(
	convertToDecimal,
	decimalToPercent,
	addPercentSign
);
getPercent(1, 4); // Output is '25%'
```
+ Redux will use reducers inside its Store to mutate its values


+ Wireframes: Drawing out what your webpage will look like with Action words
	- Focus on the "verbs" rather than the "nouns" because we're Functional
+ Actions:
	- ADD_DAY
	- REMOVE_DAY
	- SET_GOAL
	- ADD_ERROR
	- CLEAR_ERROR
	- FETCH_RESORT_NAMES
	- CANCEL_FETCHING
